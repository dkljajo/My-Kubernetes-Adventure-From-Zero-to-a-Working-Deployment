# My Kubernetes Adventure: From Zero to a Working Deployment

This project documents my journey deploying an Nginx application on Kubernetes. I faced errors, troubleshooting, and firewall issues, but finally made it fully functional. Along the way, I captured **10 screenshots** to visualize each step.

## Introduction

Deploying Kubernetes can be challenging. Matching labels, correct YAML structure, and network accessibility are all critical. This guide shows my journey from “it doesn’t work” to “live and accessible.”

## The Journey (Aligned With Screenshots)

Below is the real story of this Kubernetes task, aligned **step‑by‑step with the actual screenshots** captured during troubleshooting and validation.

---

### Step 1 – First Deployment Attempt

I started by creating my first Kubernetes Deployment. This YAML defines an **Nginx Deployment** with three replicas. At this stage, my goal was simply to get Pods running.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
    tier: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Step 2 – Pods Created but Not Yet Verified

After creating the Deployment, I checked the Pod status. This confirmed that Kubernetes was attempting to run the application.

---

### Step 3 – Validation & Configuration Errors

At this point, I ran into validation and configuration issues. Some YAML fields were misplaced, and Kubernetes rejected the configuration. This forced me to revisit label matching and structure.



---

### Step 4 – Deployment Fixed and Pods Running

After correcting the YAML (labels, selectors, and container configuration), the Deployment finally stabilized. All replicas were running successfully.

---

### Step 5 – Service Creation

With the Pods running, I needed a way to expose them externally. For that, I created a **NodePort Service**. This Service forwards traffic from a node port to port 80 on the Nginx containers.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30080
```

After applying the Service, Kubernetes successfully created it, but external access still needed verification.



---

### Step 6 – NodePort Not Reachable

Even though the Service existed, accessing it from the browser failed. This revealed that networking or firewall rules were blocking the NodePort.



---

### Step 7 – Firewall Investigation (UFW)

I identified that UFW was blocking the NodePort range. After explicitly allowing the NodePort, traffic could finally reach the cluster.

---

### Step 8 – Successful Web Access

Once the firewall rule was added, the Nginx welcome page loaded successfully in the browser — a clear sign that everything was working end‑to‑end.

### Step 10 – Final Stable State

The final state shows a fully functional Kubernetes setup: running Pods, exposed Service, open firewall port, and a reachable web application.

## Conclusion

This task was far more than just applying YAML files. It involved understanding:

* How Deployments and Services interact
* Why labels and selectors must match
* Where networking and firewall rules fit into Kubernetes

After multiple failed attempts, troubleshooting steps, and learning moments — everything finally worked. The screenshots above tell the real story of persistence, debugging, and success.

**From confusion to clarity — one NodePort at a time. **
